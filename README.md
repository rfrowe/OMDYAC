# OMDYAC
This was the first website I created. I was elected the webmaster of my tri-state youth group and created this website to manage events
and information. This exists only as legacy code and is no longer in use.

This website is not a good example of my coding ability. Being my first site, it is based off of a template that I purchased 
for $15 and heavily modified using self-taught techniques, as a result, it is not a reflection of my current abilities.

I keep this code around to serve as an archived version for [my portfolio](https://ryanrowe.name) [(source)](https://github.com/rfrowe/ryanrowe.name).
